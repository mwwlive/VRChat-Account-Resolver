# VRChat Account Resolver

Hello, welcome to the VRChat Account-Key Resolver, This will also teach you how to use this program and how to login into the accounts of said User-ID.
The basics is what we will cover at the top of the file. the bottom will tell you how to login into the accounts of admins.

( _Basics of Everything_ )

Once you open the application, you will see a Text Box and a Button named: "Check Account".

Before anything you must find the users UserID, goto the VRChat website or your VRChat Client, and copy their UserID.
Then: Put the UserID of the user you want to Resolve then click Check Account.

The users account info will pop up in the info tab, The things in this log will be: Join Date, Status, InstanceID (If public), DeveloperType, Etc!
Then you are done with the viewing part of this process. Now time for the fine dining of the hackery.

You will see a button in the logs box called Use AuthKey, if it doesn't work the program was patched and will not work for accessing accounts. (Although some accounts you cannot access, like mine.)

Then open VRChat, you should see the other users account logged into your PC/Instance, This means you can access everything. If you do want to return to normal, log-out and restart the client (If needed.) then login.

Thats really it, have fun I guess?
